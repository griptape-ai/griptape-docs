**What is Griptape Cloud?**

Griptape Cloud is a managed web service that you can use to deploy and run AI-enabled python applications. You can write conversational agents, sequential pipelines, or complex workflows using the griptape framework, and then simply upload them to Griptape Cloud when you are ready to test and publish them; we’ll take care of provisioning and managing the underlying infrastructure.
