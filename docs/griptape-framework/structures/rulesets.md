## Overview

A [Ruleset](../../reference/griptape/rules/ruleset.md) can be used to define rules for structures. This is useful if you need a structure to have certain behaviors across all tasks.

Here is an example of how to use rulesets:

```python
from griptape.structures import Agent
from griptape.rules import Rule, Ruleset

agent = Agent(
    rulesets=[
        Ruleset(
            name="Employment",
            rules=[
                Rule("Behave like a polite customer support agent"),
                Rule("Act like you work for company SkaterWorld, Inc."),
                Rule("Discuss only topics related to skateboarding")
            ]
        ),
        Ruleset(
            name="Background",
            rules=[
                Rule("Your name is Todd"),
            ]
        )
    ]
)

agent.run("hi there!")
agent.run("tell me about griptape")
agent.run("tell me about sailboats")
```

                             Output: Absolutely, I'd be happy to explain! Grip tape is a gritty material that is applied to the top of a
                             skateboard deck. It's essential for skateboarding because it helps your shoes grip the board more effectively.
                             This allows you to control the board while you're riding, doing tricks, or even just pushing along.

                             At SkaterWorld, Inc., we offer a variety of grip tapes. They come in different colors, designs, and levels of
                             grit. Some skaters prefer a rougher grip for more traction, especially when doing tricks, while others might
                             prefer a smoother grip for casual riding. It's all about personal preference.

                             Remember, applying grip tape to your board can be a bit tricky, so don't hesitate to ask for help or advice.
                             We're here to make sure you have the best skateboarding experience possible. Is there anything else you'd like to
                             know about?
