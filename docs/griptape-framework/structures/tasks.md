## Overview

A [Task](../../reference/griptape/tasks/index.md) is a purpose-built abstraction for the Large Language Model (LLM). Griptape offers various types of Tasks, each suitable for specific use cases.


## Context
Tasks that take input have a field [input](../../reference/griptape/tasks/base_text_input_task.md#griptape.tasks.base_text_input_task.BaseTextInputTask.input) which lets you define the Task objective. 
Within the [input](../../reference/griptape/tasks/base_text_input_task.md#griptape.tasks.base_text_input_task.BaseTextInputTask.input), you can access the following [context](../../reference/griptape/structures/structure.md#griptape.structures.structure.Structure.context) variables:

* `args`: an array of arguments passed to the `.run()` method.
* `structure`: the structure that the task belongs to.
* user defined context variables

Additional [context](../../reference/griptape/structures/structure.md#griptape.structures.structure.Structure.context) variables may be added based on the Structure running the task.
```python
from griptape.structures import Agent
from griptape.tasks import PromptTask


agent = Agent()
agent.add_task(
    PromptTask(
        "Respond to the user's following question '{{ args[0] }}' in the language '{{preferred_language}}' and tone '{{tone}}'.",
        context={"preferred_language": "ENGLISH", "tone": "PLAYFUL"},
    )
)

agent.run("How do I bake a cake?")
```

```

                             Input: Respond to the user's following question 'How do I bake a cake?' in the language 'ENGLISH' and tone
                             'PLAYFUL'.

                             Output: Oh, you're in for a treat! Baking a cake is like creating a masterpiece, but way more delicious! Here's a
                             simple recipe to get you started:

                             1. Preheat your oven to 350¬∞F (175¬∞C). It's like sunbathing, but for your cake!

                             2. Grab a bowl and mix together 2 cups of sugar and 1/2 cup of softened butter. It's like making sweet, buttery
                             sandcastles!

                             3. Crack in 3 eggs, one at a time, and stir in 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract. It's a pool party in your bowl!

                             4. In a separate bowl, combine 1 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour, 1 3/4 teaspoons of baking powder, and a pinch of
                             salt. This is the dry gang!

                             5. Gradually mix the dry gang into the buttery pool party. Stir until it's just combined, we don't want to
                             overwork the partygoers!

                             6. Pour the batter into a greased cake pan. It's like tucking your cake into bed!

                             7. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean. It's like playing hide and seek with your
                             cake!

                             8. Let it cool, then frost and decorate as you like. This is where you can let your creativity shine!

                             Remember, baking is all about having fun and enjoying the process. So, put on your favorite tunes, roll up your
                             sleeves, and let's get baking! üç∞üéâ

## Prompt Task

For general purpose prompting, use the [PromptTask](../../reference/griptape/tasks/prompt_task.md):

```python
from griptape.tasks import PromptTask
from griptape.structures import Agent


agent = Agent()
agent.add_task(
    # take the first argument from the agent `run` method
    PromptTask("Respond to the users following request: {{ args[0] }}"),
)

agent.run("Write me a haiku")
```

```

                             Input: Respond to the users following request:     
                             Write me a haiku

                             Output: Gentle morning dew,                        
                             Kisses the waking flowers,                         
                             Day begins anew.
```

## Toolkit Task

To use [Griptape Tools](../../griptape-framework/tools/index.md), use a [Toolkit Task](../../reference/griptape/tasks/toolkit_task.md).
This Task takes in one or more Tools which the LLM will decide to use through Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning. Because this Task uses CoT, it is recommended to only use with very capable models.

```python
from griptape.tasks import ToolkitTask
from griptape.structures import Agent
from griptape.tools import WebScraper, FileManager, TaskMemoryClient


agent = Agent()
agent.add_task(
    ToolkitTask(
        "Load https://www.griptape.ai, summarize it, and store it in a file called griptape.txt", 
        tools=[WebScraper(), FileManager(), TaskMemoryClient(off_prompt=False)]
    ),
)

agent.run()
```

```

                             Response: Griptape is an open source framework that allows developers to build and deploy AI applications
                             using large language models (LLMs). It provides the ability to create conversational and event-driven apps that
                             can access and manipulate data securely. Griptape enforces structures like sequential pipelines and DAG-based
                             workflows for predictability, while also allowing for creativity by safely prompting LLMs with external APIs and
                             data stores. The framework can be used to create AI systems that operate across both dimensions. Griptape Cloud
                             is a managed platform for deploying and managing AI apps, and it offers features like scheduling and connecting
                             to data stores and APIs.

## Tool Task

Another way to use [Griptape Tools](../../griptape-framework/tools/index.md), is with a [Tool Task](../../reference/griptape/tasks/tool_task.md). 
This Task takes in a single Tool which the LLM will use without Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning. Because this Task does not use CoT, it is better suited for less capable models.

```python
from griptape.structures import Agent
from griptape.tasks import ToolTask
from griptape.tools import Calculator

# Initialize the agent and add a task
agent = Agent()
agent.add_task(ToolTask(tool=Calculator()))

# Run the agent with a prompt
agent.run("Give me the answer for 5*4.")
```

```

```

## Extraction Task

To extract information from text, use an [ExtractionTask](../../reference/griptape/tasks/extraction_task.md).
This Task takes an [Extraction Engine](../../griptape-framework/engines/extraction-engines.md), and a set of arguments specific to the Engine.


### CSV Extraction

```python
from griptape.drivers import OpenAiChatPromptDriver
from griptape.tasks import ExtractionTask
from griptape.structures import Agent
from griptape.engines import CsvExtractionEngine

# Instantiate the CSV extraction engine
csv_extraction_engine = CsvExtractionEngine(
    prompt_driver=OpenAiChatPromptDriver(model="gpt-3.5-turbo")
)

# Define some unstructured data and columns
csv_data = """
Alice, 28, lives in New York.
Bob, 35 lives in California.
Charlie is 40 and lives in Texas.
"""

columns = ["Name", "Age", "Address"]


# Create an agent and add the ExtractionTask to it
agent = Agent()
agent.add_task(
    ExtractionTask(
        extraction_engine=csv_extraction_engine,
        args={"column_names": columns},
    )
)

# Run the agent
agent.run(csv_data)
```
```

                             Charlie,40,Texas
```

### JSON Extraction

```python
from schema import Schema 

from griptape.drivers import OpenAiChatPromptDriver
from griptape.tasks import ExtractionTask
from griptape.structures import Agent
from griptape.engines import JsonExtractionEngine

# Instantiate the json extraction engine
json_extraction_engine = JsonExtractionEngine(

user_schema = Schema(
    {"users": [{"name": str, "age": int, "location": str}]}
).json_schema("UserSchema")

agent = Agent()
agent.add_task(
    ExtractionTask(
        extraction_engine=json_extraction_engine,
        args={"template_schema": user_schema},
    )
)

# Run the agent
agent.run(json_data)

```

## Text Summary Task

To summarize a text, use the [TextSummaryTask](../../reference/griptape/tasks/text_summary_task.md).
This Task takes an [Summarization Engine](../../griptape-framework/engines/summary-engines.md), and a set of arguments to the engine.

```python
from griptape.structures import Agent
from griptape.tasks import TextSummaryTask

# Create a new agent
agent = Agent()

# Add the TextSummaryTask to the agent
agent.add_task(TextSummaryTask())


# Run the agent

## Text Query Task

To query text, use the [TextQueryTask](../../reference/griptape/tasks/text_query_task.md).
This Task takes a [Query Engine](../../griptape-framework/engines/query-engines.md), and a set of arguments specific to the engine.

```python
from griptape.drivers import OpenAiChatPromptDriver
from griptape.structures import Agent
from griptape.tasks import TextQueryTask
from griptape.drivers import LocalVectorStoreDriver, OpenAiEmbeddingDriver
from griptape.engines import VectorQueryEngine
from griptape.artifacts import TextArtifact

# Initialize Embedding Driver and Vector Store Driver
vector_store_driver = LocalVectorStoreDriver(embedding_driver=OpenAiEmbeddingDriver())

artifact = TextArtifact(
    "Griptape builds AI-powered applications that connect securely to your enterprise data and APIs."
    "Griptape Agents provide incredible power and flexibility when working with large language models."
)

# Create a VectorQueryEngine using the LocalVectorStoreDriver
vector_query_engine = VectorQueryEngine(
    vector_store_driver=vector_store_driver,
    prompt_driver=OpenAiChatPromptDriver(model="gpt-3.5-turbo")
)
vector_query_engine.upsert_text_artifact(artifact=artifact)

# Instantiate the agent and add TextQueryTask with the VectorQueryEngine
agent = Agent()
agent.add_task(
    TextQueryTask(
        "Respond to the users following query: {{ args[0] }}",
        query_engine=vector_query_engine,
    )
)

# Run the agent with a query string
agent.run("Give me information about Griptape")
```

```

```

## Code Execution Task

To execute an arbitrary Python function, use the [CodeExecutionTask](../../reference/griptape/tasks/text_query_task.md).
This task takes a python function, and authors can elect to return a custom artifact.

```python 
from griptape.structures import Pipeline
from griptape.tasks import CodeExecutionTask, PromptTask
from griptape.artifacts import BaseArtifact, TextArtifact


def character_counter(task: CodeExecutionTask) -> BaseArtifact:
    result = len(task.input)
    # For functions that don't need to return anything, we recommend returning task.input
    return TextArtifact(str(result))


# Instantiate the pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline()

pipeline.add_tasks(

    # take the first argument from the pipeline `run` method
    CodeExecutionTask(run_fn=character_counter),
    # # take the output from the previous task and insert it into the prompt
    PromptTask("{{args[0]}} using {{ parent_output }} characters")
)

pipeline.run("Write me a line in a poem")
```

```

                             Output: "Silent code, loud impact."  
```

## Image Generation Tasks

To generate an image, use one of the following [Image Generation Tasks](../../reference/griptape/tasks/index.md). All Image Generation Tasks accept an [Image Generation Engine](../engines/image-generation-engines.md) configured to use an [Image Generation Driver](../drivers/image-generation-drivers.md).

All successful Image Generation Tasks will always output an [Image Artifact](../data/artifacts.md#imageartifact). Each task can be configured to additionally write the generated image to disk by providing either the `output_file` or `output_dir` field. The `output_file` field supports file names in the current directory (`my_image.png`), relative directory prefixes (`images/my_image.png`), or absolute paths (`/usr/var/my_image.png`). By setting `output_dir`, the task will generate a file name and place the image in the requested directory.

### Prompt Image Generation Task

The [Prompt Image Generation Task](../../reference/griptape/tasks/prompt_image_generation_task.md) generates an image from a text prompt.

```python
from griptape.engines import PromptImageGenerationEngine
from griptape.drivers import OpenAiImageGenerationDriver
from griptape.tasks import PromptImageGenerationTask
from griptape.structures import Pipeline


# Create a driver configured to use OpenAI's DALL-E 3 model.
driver = OpenAiImageGenerationDriver(
    model="dall-e-3",
    quality="hd",
    style="natural",
)

# Create an engine configured to use the driver.
engine = PromptImageGenerationEngine(
    image_generation_driver=driver,
)

# Instantiate a pipeline.
pipeline = Pipeline()

# Add a PromptImageGenerationTask to the pipeline.
pipeline.add_tasks(
    PromptImageGenerationTask(
        input="{{ args[0] }}",
        image_generation_engine=engine,
        output_dir="images/",
    )
)

pipeline.run("An image of a mountain on a summer day")
```

### Variation Image Generation Task

The [Variation Image Generation Task](../../reference/griptape/tasks/variation_image_generation_task.md) generates an image using an input image and a text prompt. The input image is used as a basis for generating a new image as requested by the text prompt.

```python
from griptape.engines import VariationImageGenerationEngine
from griptape.drivers import AmazonBedrockImageGenerationDriver, \
    BedrockStableDiffusionImageGenerationModelDriver
from griptape.tasks import VariationImageGenerationTask
from griptape.loaders import ImageLoader
from griptape.structures import Pipeline


# Create a driver configured to use Stable Diffusion via Bedrock.
driver = AmazonBedrockImageGenerationDriver(
    image_generation_model_driver=BedrockStableDiffusionImageGenerationModelDriver(),
    model="stability.stable-diffusion-xl-v0",
)

# Create an engine configured to use the driver.
engine = VariationImageGenerationEngine(
    image_generation_driver=driver,
)

# Load input image artifact.
with open("tests/assets/mountain.png", "rb") as f:
    image_artifact = ImageLoader().load(f.read())

# Instatiate a pipeline.
pipeline = Pipeline()

# Add a VariationImageGenerationTask to the pipeline.
pipeline.add_task(
    VariationImageGenerationTask(
        input=("{{ args[0] }}", image_artifact),
        image_generation_engine=engine,
        output_dir="images/",
    )
)

pipeline.run("An image of a mountain landscape on a snowy winter day")
```

### Inpainting Image Generation Task

The [Inpainting Image Generation Task](../../reference/griptape/tasks/inpainting_image_generation_task.md) generates an image using an input image, a mask image, and a text prompt. The input image will be modified within the bounds of the mask image as requested by the text prompt.

```python
from griptape.engines import InpaintingImageGenerationEngine
from griptape.drivers import AmazonBedrockImageGenerationDriver, \
    BedrockStableDiffusionImageGenerationModelDriver
from griptape.tasks import InpaintingImageGenerationTask
from griptape.loaders import ImageLoader
from griptape.structures import Pipeline


# Create a driver configured to use Stable Diffusion via Bedrock.
driver = AmazonBedrockImageGenerationDriver(
    image_generation_model_driver=BedrockStableDiffusionImageGenerationModelDriver(),
    model="stability.stable-diffusion-xl-v0",
)

# Create an engine configured to use the driver.
engine = InpaintingImageGenerationEngine(
    image_generation_driver=driver,
)

# Load input image artifacts.
with open("tests/assets/mountain.png", "rb") as f:
    image_artifact = ImageLoader().load(f.read())

with open("tests/assets/mountain-mask.png", "rb") as f:
    mask_artifact = ImageLoader().load(f.read())

# Instantiate a pipeline.
pipeline = Pipeline()

# Add an InpaintingImageGenerationTask to the pipeline.
pipeline.add_task(
    InpaintingImageGenerationTask(
        input=("{{ args[0] }}", image_artifact, mask_artifact),
        image_generation_engine=engine,
        output_dir="images/"
    )
)

pipeline.run("An image of a castle built into the side of a mountain")
```

### Outpainting Image Generation Task

The [Outpainting Image Generation Task](../../reference/griptape/tasks/outpainting_image_generation_task.md) generates an image using an input image, a mask image, and a text prompt. The input image will be modified outside the bounds of a mask image as requested by the text prompt.

```python
from griptape.engines import OutpaintingImageGenerationEngine
from griptape.drivers import AmazonBedrockImageGenerationDriver, \
    BedrockStableDiffusionImageGenerationModelDriver
from griptape.tasks import OutpaintingImageGenerationTask
from griptape.loaders import ImageLoader
from griptape.structures import Pipeline


# Create a driver configured to use Stable Diffusion via Bedrock.
driver = AmazonBedrockImageGenerationDriver(
    image_generation_model_driver=BedrockStableDiffusionImageGenerationModelDriver(),
    model="stability.stable-diffusion-xl-v0",
)

# Create an engine configured to use the driver.
engine = OutpaintingImageGenerationEngine(
    image_generation_driver=driver,
)

# Load input image artifacts.
with open("tests/assets/mountain.png", "rb") as f:
    image_artifact = ImageLoader().load(f.read())

with open("tests/assets/mountain-mask.png", "rb") as f:
    mask_artifact = ImageLoader().load(f.read())

# Instantiate a pipeline.
pipeline = Pipeline()

# Add an OutpaintingImageGenerationTask to the pipeline.
pipeline.add_task(
    OutpaintingImageGenerationTask(
        input=("{{ args[0] }}", image_artifact, mask_artifact),
        image_generation_engine=engine,
        output_dir="images/",
    )
)

pipeline.run("An image of a mountain shrouded by clouds")
```

## Image Query Task

The [Image Query Task](../../reference/griptape/tasks/image_query_task.md) executes a natural language query on one or more input images. This Task uses an [Image Query Engine](../engines/image-query-engines.md) configured with an [Image Query Driver](../drivers/image-query-drivers.md) to perform the query. The functionality provided by this Task depend on the capabilities of the model provided by the Driver.

This Task accepts two inputs: a query (represented by either a string or a [Text Artifact](../data/artifacts.md#textartifact)) and a list of [Image Artifacts](../data/artifacts.md#imageartifact) or a Callable returning these two values.

```python
from griptape.engines import ImageQueryEngine
from griptape.drivers import OpenAiVisionImageQueryDriver
from griptape.tasks import ImageQueryTask
from griptape.loaders import ImageLoader
from griptape.structures import Pipeline


# Create a driver configured to use OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision model.
driver = OpenAiVisionImageQueryDriver(
    model="gpt-4-vision-preview",
    max_tokens=100,
)

# Create an engine configured to use the driver.
engine = ImageQueryEngine(
    image_query_driver=driver,
)

# Load the input image artifact.
with open("tests/assets/mountain.png", "rb") as f:
    image_artifact = ImageLoader().load(f.read())

# Instantiate a pipeline.
pipeline = Pipeline()

# Add an ImageQueryTask to the pipeline.
pipeline.add_task(
    ImageQueryTask(
        input=("{{ args[0] }}", [image_artifact]),
        image_query_engine=engine,
    )
)

pipeline.run("Describe the weather in the image")
```
