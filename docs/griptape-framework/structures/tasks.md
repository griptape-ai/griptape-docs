## Overview

Tasks are purpose-built objectives that can be given to the LLM. Griptape provides several types of tasks that can be used depending on the use-case. 

## Context
Tasks take in a field `input_template` which lets you define the task objective. Within the `input_template`, you can access the following context variables:

* `args`: an array of arguments passed to the `.run()` method.
* `structure`: the structure that the task belongs to.
* user defined context variables

Depending on the structure that is running the task, additional context variables will be added.
```python
from griptape.structures import Agent
from griptape.tasks import PromptTask


agent = Agent()
agent.add_task(
    PromptTask(
        "Respond to the user's following question '{{ args[0] }}' in the language '{{preferred_language}}' and tone '{{tone}}'.",
        context={"preferred_language": "ENGLISH", "tone": "PLAYFUL"},
    )
)

agent.run("How do I bake a cake?")
```

```

                             Input: Respond to the user's following question 'How do I bake a cake?' in the language 'ENGLISH' and tone
                             'PLAYFUL'.

                             Output: Oh, you're in for a treat! Baking a cake is like creating a masterpiece, but way more delicious! Here's a
                             simple recipe to get you started:

                             1. Preheat your oven to 350¬∞F (175¬∞C). It's like sunbathing, but for your cake!

                             2. Grab a bowl and mix together 2 cups of sugar and 1/2 cup of softened butter. It's like making sweet, buttery
                             sandcastles!

                             3. Crack in 3 eggs, one at a time, and stir in 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract. It's a pool party in your bowl!

                             4. In a separate bowl, combine 1 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour, 1 3/4 teaspoons of baking powder, and a pinch of
                             salt. This is the dry gang!

                             5. Gradually mix the dry gang into the buttery pool party. Stir until it's just combined, we don't want to
                             overwork the partygoers!

                             6. Pour the batter into a greased cake pan. It's like tucking your cake into bed!

                             7. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean. It's like playing hide and seek with your
                             cake!

                             8. Let it cool, then frost and decorate as you like. This is where you can let your creativity shine!

                             Remember, baking is all about having fun and enjoying the process. So, put on your favorite tunes, roll up your
                             sleeves, and let's get baking! üç∞üéâ

## PromptTask

For general purpose prompting, you can use the [PromptTask](../../reference/griptape/tasks/prompt_task.md):

```python
from griptape.tasks import PromptTask
from griptape.structures import Agent


agent = Agent()
agent.add_task(
    # take the first argument from the pipeline `run` method
    PromptTask("{{ args[0] }}"),
)

agent.run("Write me a haiku")
```

```
[09/08/23 11:14:05] INFO     PromptTask 6fea76df25d246e9b15fb5878156034e
                             Input: Write me a haiku
[09/08/23 11:14:07] INFO     PromptTask 6fea76df25d246e9b15fb5878156034e
                             Output: Golden sunsets glow,
                             Whispers of the wind echo,
                             Nature's peace bestowed.
```

## ToolkitTask

To use [Griptape Tools](../../griptape-framework/tools/index.md), you can use the [ToolkitTask](../../reference/griptape/tasks/toolkit_task.md).
This task allows us to pass in one or more tools, and the LLM will use Chain of Thought (CoT) to reason through which tools it should use given the prompt.

```python
from griptape.tasks import ToolkitTask
from griptape.structures import Agent
from griptape.tools import WebScraper, FileManager


agent = Agent()
agent.add_task(
    ToolkitTask(
        "Load https://www.griptape.ai, summarize it, and store it in a file called griptape.txt", 
        tools=[WebScraper(), FileManager()]
    ),
)

agent.run()
```

```

                             Observation: Griptape is an open source framework that allows developers to build and deploy AI applications
                             using large language models (LLMs). It provides the ability to create conversational and event-driven apps that
                             can access and manipulate data securely. Griptape enforces structures like sequential pipelines and DAG-based
                             workflows for predictability, while also allowing for creativity by safely prompting LLMs with external APIs and
                             data stores. The framework can be used to create AI systems that operate across both dimensions. Griptape Cloud
                             is a managed platform for deploying and managing AI apps, and it offers features like scheduling and connecting
                             to data stores and APIs.
