## Overview

A [Task](../../reference/griptape/tasks/index.md) is a purpose-built objective that can be given to the LLM. Griptape provides several types of Tasks that can be used depending on the use-case. 

## Context
Tasks that take input have a field [input_template](../../reference/griptape/tasks/base_text_input_task.md#griptape.tasks.base_text_input_task.BaseTextInputTask.input_template) which lets you define the Task objective. 
Within the [input_template](../../reference/griptape/tasks/base_text_input_task.md#griptape.tasks.base_text_input_task.BaseTextInputTask.input_template), you can access the following [context](../../reference/griptape/structures/structure.md#griptape.structures.structure.Structure.context) variables:

* `args`: an array of arguments passed to the `.run()` method.
* `structure`: the structure that the task belongs to.
* user defined context variables

Depending on the Structure that is running the task, additional [context](../../reference/griptape/structures/structure.md#griptape.structures.structure.Structure.context) variables will be added.
```python
from griptape.structures import Agent
from griptape.tasks import PromptTask


agent = Agent()
agent.add_task(
    PromptTask(
        "Respond to the user's following question '{{ args[0] }}' in the language '{{preferred_language}}' and tone '{{tone}}'.",
        context={"preferred_language": "ENGLISH", "tone": "PLAYFUL"},
    )
)

agent.run("How do I bake a cake?")
```

```

                             Input: Respond to the user's following question 'How do I bake a cake?' in the language 'ENGLISH' and tone
                             'PLAYFUL'.

                             Output: Oh, you're in for a treat! Baking a cake is like creating a masterpiece, but way more delicious! Here's a
                             simple recipe to get you started:

                             1. Preheat your oven to 350¬∞F (175¬∞C). It's like sunbathing, but for your cake!

                             2. Grab a bowl and mix together 2 cups of sugar and 1/2 cup of softened butter. It's like making sweet, buttery
                             sandcastles!

                             3. Crack in 3 eggs, one at a time, and stir in 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract. It's a pool party in your bowl!

                             4. In a separate bowl, combine 1 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour, 1 3/4 teaspoons of baking powder, and a pinch of
                             salt. This is the dry gang!

                             5. Gradually mix the dry gang into the buttery pool party. Stir until it's just combined, we don't want to
                             overwork the partygoers!

                             6. Pour the batter into a greased cake pan. It's like tucking your cake into bed!

                             7. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean. It's like playing hide and seek with your
                             cake!

                             8. Let it cool, then frost and decorate as you like. This is where you can let your creativity shine!

                             Remember, baking is all about having fun and enjoying the process. So, put on your favorite tunes, roll up your
                             sleeves, and let's get baking! üç∞üéâ

## Prompt Task

For general purpose prompting, you can use the [PromptTask](.../../reference/griptape/tasks/prompt_task.md):

```python
from griptape.tasks import PromptTask
from griptape.structures import Agent


agent = Agent()
agent.add_task(
    # take the first argument from the agent `run` method
    PromptTask("Respond to the users following request: {{ args[0] }}"),
)

agent.run("Write me a haiku")
```

```

                             Input: Respond to the users following request:     
                             Write me a haiku

                             Output: Gentle morning dew,                        
                             Kisses the waking flowers,                         
                             Day begins anew.
```

## Toolkit Task

To use [Griptape Tools](../../griptape-framework/tools/index.md), you can use a [Toolkit Task](../../reference/griptape/tasks/toolkit_task.md).
This Task takes in one or more tools which the LLM will decide to use using Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning. Because this Task uses CoT, it is recommended to only use with very capable models.

```python
from griptape.tasks import ToolkitTask
from griptape.structures import Agent
from griptape.tools import WebScraper, FileManager


agent = Agent()
agent.add_task(
    ToolkitTask(
        "Load https://www.griptape.ai, summarize it, and store it in a file called griptape.txt", 
        tools=[WebScraper(), FileManager()]
    ),
)

agent.run()
```

```

                             Observation: Griptape is an open source framework that allows developers to build and deploy AI applications
                             using large language models (LLMs). It provides the ability to create conversational and event-driven apps that
                             can access and manipulate data securely. Griptape enforces structures like sequential pipelines and DAG-based
                             workflows for predictability, while also allowing for creativity by safely prompting LLMs with external APIs and
                             data stores. The framework can be used to create AI systems that operate across both dimensions. Griptape Cloud
                             is a managed platform for deploying and managing AI apps, and it offers features like scheduling and connecting
                             to data stores and APIs.

## Tool Task

Another way to use [Griptape Tools](../../griptape-framework/tools/index.md), is with a [Tool Task](../../griptape-framework/structures/tasks.md). This Task takes in a single Tool which the LLM will use without Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning. Because this Task does not use CoT, it is better suited for less capable models.

```python
from griptape.structures import Agent
from griptape.tasks import ToolTask
from griptape.tools import Calculator

# Initialize the agent and add a task
agent = Agent()
agent.add_task(ToolTask(tool=Calculator()))

# Run the agent with a prompt
agent.run("Give me the answer for 5*4.")
```

```

```

## Extraction Task

To extract information from a text, you can use the [ExtractionTask](../../griptape-framework/structures/tasks.md). This task allows us to pass in an [Extraction Engine](../../griptape-framework/data/extraction-engines.md) and a set of arguments to the engine.

```python
from griptape.tasks import ExtractionTask

from griptape.engines import CsvExtractionEngine

# Instantiate the CSV extraction engine
csv_extraction_engine = CsvExtractionEngine()

# Define some CSV data and columns
csv_data = """

John, 25, 123 Main St
Jane, 30, 456 Elm St

columns = ["Name", "Age", "Address"]


# Create an agent and add the ExtractionTask to it
agent = Agent()
agent.add_task(
    ExtractionTask(
        extraction_engine=csv_extraction_engine,
        args={"column_names": columns},
    )
)

# Run the agent
agent.run(csv_data)

## Text Summary Task

To summarize a text, you can use the [TextSummaryTask](../../griptape-framework/structures/tasks.md). This task allows us to pass in a [Summarization Engine](../../griptape-framework/data/summarization-engines.md) and a set of arguments to the engine.

```python
from griptape.structures import Agent

# Create a new agent
agent = Agent()

# Add the TextSummaryTask to the agent
agent.add_task(TextSummaryTask())


# Run the agent

                             important to make computers intelligent so that our
                             lives become easy. Artificial Intelligence is the  
                             theory and development of computers, which imitates
                             the human intelligence and senses, such as visual  
                             perception, speech recognition, decision-making,   
                             and translation between languages. Artificial      
                             Intelligence has brought a revolution in the world 
                             of technology.

## Text Query Task

To query a text, you can use the [TextQueryTask](../../griptape-framework/structures/tasks.md). This task allows us to pass in a [Query Engine](../../griptape-framework/data/query-engines.md) and a set of arguments to the engine.

```python
import os
from griptape.structures import Agent
from griptape.tasks import TextQueryTask
from griptape.drivers import LocalVectorStoreDriver, OpenAiEmbeddingDriver
from griptape.engines import VectorQueryEngine
from griptape.artifacts import TextArtifact

# Initiate Embedding Driver and Vector Store Driver
embedding_driver = OpenAiEmbeddingDriver()
vector_store_driver = LocalVectorStoreDriver(embedding_driver=embedding_driver)

st1 = TextArtifact("Griptape builds AI-powered applications that connect securely to your enterprise data and APIs.")
st2 = TextArtifact("Griptape Agents provide incredible power and flexibility when working with large language models.")

# Create a VectorQueryEngine using the LocalVectorStoreDriver
vector_query_engine = VectorQueryEngine(
    vector_store_driver=vector_store_driver
)

vector_query_engine.upsert_text_artifact(artifact=st1)
vector_query_engine.upsert_text_artifact(artifact=st2)

# Instantiate the agent and add TextQueryTask with the VectorQueryEngine
agent = Agent()
agent.add_task(
    TextQueryTask(
        "Respond to the users following query: {{ args[0] }}",
        query_engine=vector_query_engine
    )
)

# Run the agent with a query string
agent.run("Give me information about Griptape")
```

```
