## Overview 

Workflows are non-sequential DAGs that can be used for complex concurrent scenarios with tasks having multiple inputs.


## Context

`Workflow` structures have access to the following context variables in addition to the base [context](./tasks.md#context):

* `parent_outputs`: outputs into the current task referenceable by parent task IDs.
* `parents`: parent tasks referenceable by IDs.
* `children`: child tasks referenceable by IDs.

## Workflow
Let's build a simple workflow. Let's say, we want to write a story in a fantasy world with some unique characters. We could setup a workflow that generates a world based on some keywords. Then we pass the world description to any number of child tasks that create characters. Finally, the last task pulls in information from all parent tasks and writes up a short story.

```python
from griptape.tasks import PromptTask
from griptape.structures import Workflow

def character_task(task_id, character_name) -> PromptTask:
    return PromptTask(
        "Based on the following world description create a character named {{ name }}:\n{{ parent_outputs['world'] }}",
        context={
            "name": character_name
        },
        id=task_id
    )

world_task = PromptTask(
    "Create a fictional world based on the following key words {{ keywords|join(', ') }}",
    context={
        "keywords": ["fantasy", "ocean", "tidal lock"]
    },
    id="world"
)

character_task_1 = character_task("scotty", "Scotty")
character_task_2 = character_task("annie", "Annie")

story_task = PromptTask(
    "Based on the following description of the world and characters, write a short story:\n{{ parent_outputs['world'] }}\n{{ parent_outputs['scotty'] }}\n{{ parent_outputs['annie'] }}",
    id="story"
)

workflow = Workflow()

workflow.add_task(world_task)

world_task.add_child(character_task_1)
world_task.add_child(character_task_2)
world_task.add_child(story_task)

character_task_1.add_child(story_task)
character_task_2.add_child(story_task)

workflow.run()
```

                             Oceanus Fantasia is a vast, water-dominated planet, with its surface covered by a seemingly endless ocean. The
                             ocean is not just water, but a magical liquid that sparkles with all the colors of the rainbow under the planet's
                             twin suns. This magical ocean is home to a myriad of fantastical creatures, from the tiny luminescent pixie-fish
                             to the colossal, wise leviathans that roam the depths.
