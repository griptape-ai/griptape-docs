## Overview

One of the most powerful features of Griptape is the ability for Toolkit Tasks to generate _chains of thought_ (CoT) and use tools that can interact with the outside world. We use the [ReAct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) technique to implement CoT reasoning and acting in the underlying LLMs without using any fine-tuning.

Griptape implements the reasoning loop in the Toolkit Tasks and integrates Griptape Tools natively.

## Tools
Here is an example of a pipeline using tools: 

```python
from griptape.tasks import ToolkitTask
from griptape.structures import Pipeline
from griptape.tools import WebScraper, FileManager, TaskMemoryClient


pipeline = Pipeline()

pipeline.add_tasks(
    ToolkitTask(
        "Load https://www.griptape.ai, summarize it, and store it in a file called griptape.txt", 
        tools=[WebScraper(), FileManager(), TaskMemoryClient(off_prompt=False)]
    ),
)

pipeline.run()
```

```

                             Thought: The first step is to load the content of the webpage. I can use the WebScraper tool with the get_content

                             Response: Griptape is an open source framework that allows developers to build and deploy AI applications
                             using large language models (LLMs). It provides the ability to create conversational and event-driven apps that
                             can access and manipulate data securely. Griptape enforces structures like sequential pipelines and workflows for
                             predictability, while also allowing for creativity by safely prompting LLMs with external APIs and data stores.
                             The framework can be used to create AI systems that operate across both predictability and creativity dimensions.
                             Griptape Cloud is a managed platform for deploying and managing AI apps.
