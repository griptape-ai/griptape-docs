## Overview
Tool Memory augments activity inputs and outputs with storage capabilities. It's a way to keep any data generated by tools off prompt but still allow LLMs to operate on that data remotely. This is useful in the following scenarios:

* **Security requirements**: many organizations don't want data to leave their cloud for regulatory and security reasons.
* **Long textual content**: when textual content returned by tools can't fit in the token limit, it's often useful to perform operations on it in a separate process, not in the main LLM.
* **Non-textual content**: tools can generate images, videos, PDFs, and other non-textual content that can be stored in memory and acted upon later by other tools.

By default, Griptape augments all tool outputs with [TextToolMemory](../../reference/griptape/memory/tool/text_tool_memory.md) but you can override at the structure, task, or tool activity level.


## Tool Memory
Here is an example of how memory can be used in unison with multiple tools to store and load content:

```python
from griptape.memory.tool import TextToolMemory, BlobToolMemory
from griptape.structures import Agent
from griptape.tools import WebScraper, FileManager, ToolOutputProcessor
from griptape.engines import VectorQueryEngine
from griptape.drivers import LocalVectorStoreDriver, OpenAiEmbeddingDriver

"""
Define tool memory for storing textual and
non-textual content.
"""
text_memory = TextToolMemory(
    # Disable all memory activities, so we can use
    # ToolOutputProcessor as a tool later.
    allowlist=[],
    query_engine=VectorQueryEngine(
        vector_store_driver=LocalVectorStoreDriver(
            embedding_driver=OpenAiEmbeddingDriver()
        )
    ),
)
blob_memory = BlobToolMemory()

"""
WebScraper enables LLMs to web pages.

Here we wrap WebScraper's `get_content` activity
in the text memory. Any result from this
activity will be stored in that memory and the result
ID will be returned to the LLM.
"""
web_scraper = WebScraper(
    output_memory={
        "get_content": [text_memory]
    }
)

"""
FileManager enables LLMs to store and load files from disk.

Here we set input_memory for tool activities to pull data from and
wrap the `load_files_from_disk` activity output with the blob memory.
"""
file_manager = FileManager(
    input_memory=[text_memory],
    output_memory={
        "load_files_from_disk": [blob_memory]
    }
)

"""
ToolOutputProcessor enables LLMs to browse, extract, and query text memory.
"""
memory_browser = ToolOutputProcessor(
    input_memory=[text_memory]
)

agent = Agent(
    tools=[web_scraper, file_manager, memory_browser]
)

agent.run(
    "Load https://www.griptape.ai, summarize it, "
    "and store it in griptape.txt"
)

```

                             Observation: Griptape is an open source framework that allows developers to build and deploy AI applications
                             using large language models (LLMs). It provides the ability to create conversational and event-driven apps that
                             can access and manipulate data securely. The framework enforces structures like sequential pipelines and
                             DAG-based workflows for predictability, while also allowing for creativity by safely prompting LLMs with external
                             APIs and data stores. Griptape Cloud is a managed platform for deploying and managing AI apps.
