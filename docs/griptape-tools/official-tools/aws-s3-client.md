# AwsS3Client

This tool enables LLMs to make AWS S3 API requests.

```python
import boto3
from griptape.structures import Agent
from griptape.tools import AwsS3Client, TaskMemoryClient

# Initialize the AWS S3 client
aws_s3_client = AwsS3Client(
    session=boto3.Session()
)

# Create an agent with the AWS S3 client tool
agent = Agent(
    tools=[aws_s3_client, TaskMemoryClient(off_prompt=False)]
)

# Task to list all the AWS S3 buckets
agent.run("List all my S3 buckets.")
```
```
