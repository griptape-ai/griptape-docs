# SqlClient

This tool enables LLMs to execute SQL statements via [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/). Depending on your underlying SQL engine, [configure](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/engines.html) your `engine_url` and give the LLM a hint about what engine you are using via `engine_name`, so that it can create engine-specific statements.

```python
import os
import boto3
from griptape.drivers import AmazonRedshiftSqlDriver
from griptape.loaders import SqlLoader
from griptape.structures import Agent
from griptape.tools import SqlClient, TaskMemoryClient


session = boto3.Session()

sql_loader = SqlLoader(
    sql_driver=AmazonRedshiftSqlDriver(
        database=os.getenv("REDSHIFT_DATABASE"),
        session=session,
        cluster_identifier=os.getenv('REDSHIFT_CLUSTER_IDENTIFIER'),
    )
)

sql_tool = SqlClient(
    sql_loader=sql_loader,
    table_name="people",
    table_description="contains information about tech industry professionals",
    engine_name="redshift"
)

agent = Agent(
    tools=[sql_tool, TaskMemoryClient(off_prompt=False)]
)
agent.run("SELECT * FROM people;")
