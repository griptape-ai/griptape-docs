                             Output: Photosynthesis is the process by which     
                             plants, algae, and certain bacteria convert light  
                             energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy 
                             in the form of glucose or sugar. This process      
                             involves several steps:                            
                                                                                
                             1. Absorption of light: The process begins when    
                             light is absorbed by proteins containing           
                             chlorophylls (pigments) present in chloroplasts.   
                                                                                
                             2. Conversion of light energy to chemical energy:  
                             The absorbed light energy is used to convert carbon
                             dioxide from the atmosphere and water from the soil
                             into glucose. This conversion process occurs       
                             through a series of chemical reactions known as the
                             light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle.    
                                                                                
                             3. Release of oxygen: As a byproduct of these      
                             reactions, oxygen is produced and released into the
                             atmosphere.                                        
                                                                                
                             4. Use of glucose: The glucose produced is used by 
                             the plant for growth and development. It can also  
                             be stored for later use.                           
                                                                                
                             In summary, photosynthesis is a vital process for  
                             life on Earth as it is the primary source of oxygen
                             in the atmosphere and forms the basis of the food  
                             chain.
